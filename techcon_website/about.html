            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 50 passionate developers in a modest conference room in Silicon Valley. What started as an informal meetup to discuss emerging web technologies has evolved into one of the most prestigious technology conferences in the world, attracting over 5,000 attendees annually.</p>
